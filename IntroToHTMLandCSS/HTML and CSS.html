<!-- This is the HTML structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
      MY CODE
 </head>
  <body>
      MY CODE
  </body>
</html>

EXPLENATION: 

The HTML structure must always be followed and cannot be written more than 1 time in the same file.
This first line's only purpose is telling to the broswer to use a more recent version of HTML in order to have more features we can use. If omitted, we will use an older HTML version.

Then we have html tag (<html></html>), which represents the entiere web page and contains head and body tags. Containing others tags is a feature called nesting.

Both tags can contain the code we write but head contains only the things which WILL NOT be visible on the page, body can contaion only the things that will be visible on the page.
So CSS will be placed in head tag, while HTML in the body.

NOTE: 

The best thing to do is putting CSS code in a separated file with css extension (ex: fileName.css). So we will have 2 files: one for HTML, one for CSS.
To link the two files, in head section of HTML file we need to write:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="">

This means that we are linking a stylesheet whose name is written inside href attibute. So we will have something like:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS code.css">

Please note that href attribute will be able to find the CSS file only if it in the same folder of the HTML file we are working on.
If it is in a different folder, we will need to write the full filepath. So it will be something like: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="nameOfTheFolder/CSS code.css">

In this way, the code will be "cleaner". 
For this time, I will put HTML and CSS togheter for this time because I have technical problems in uniting them.
I created a file called: "mini-project" just to show how to work with HTML and CSS in two different files.

Note that exist some kind of tag called void tags which have the feature of not having a closing tag. link and img tags are 2 examples.

  <div><!-- CSS theory -->
    <style> 
    /* 
      CSS is used to modify the style of our web pages. 
      NOTE: HTML tags can modify the style of the web page BUT it is not its purpose since it only define the structure of the page. Everything about the style of the page is CSS' concern. 

      Example: if we want a word to be written in bold we can use the tag "strong" to have this style effect and this is ok because the result is archieved but a developer must not rely on this mindset.
      To get a style modify CSS is the first thing to think about.
      Another important thing, also in general, is to be coherent. For example: if I decide to archieve bold writing using strong tag once, I must keep using that strategy throughout all the project.

      "style" is the basic tag in CSS: it tells the compiler that we are going to write CSS untill its closing tab:
      
      CSS is like HTML: compiler reads the instructions one by one in the order we write them.

        CSS works with selectors and properties and, as for the tags and attributes in HTML, each one does a specific action. Example:

        button { 
        background-color: red;
      }

      button is the CSS selector
      background-color is a CSS property which modifies the background color of the selector with its value which, in this case, is "red"
      Note that if we write like that, the modifies inside the curly brackets are going to affect ALL the tags called "button" in our HTML code.

      If we want to target/modify a specific tag of our code, we need to give him a "specific name". 
      This is done like adding to the HTML tag an HTML attribute called class. Here is how we do:

      First we have our HTML tag inside our HTML script:

        <button>SUBSCRIBE</button>

      Second we modify the tag with class attribute like this:

        <button class = thisIsTheSpecificNameOfThisTag >SUBSCRIBE</button>

      Third we need write inside our CSS script now, contained in "style" tag, and write like this:

        .thisIsTheSpecificNameOfThisTag{
          background-color: red;
        }

      As we can see, now the selector is no long a generic HTML tag name but it has a dot followed by the value of the "class" attribute which is inside the HTML opening tag.
      Note that the same attribute's value can be used in more tags. As a matter of fact, this is perfectly fine:

        <button class = JOINbutton> JOIN </button>
        <button class = JOINbutton> DO NOT JOIN </button>

        "style" opening tag (I will not write the acutal tag because it creates problems, even if I am writing inside a comment)

        .JOINbutton{
          ...
        }

        "style" closing tag

      */
    </style>

  <div><!--HTML theory
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language and uses tags to create web pages.
      Each thing put into <> and </> is called opening or closing tag.
      Tags can have attributes which modify the way an element behaves.
      Attributes have got a value which determinates exactly how the attribue is going to modify the behaveour of a tag.
      Compiler reads the instructions/tags we write line by line so this is also the order of execution and the order with which things are displayed on browsers, like Google Chrome.


      Here is an example: 

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=3703s" target="_blank">Link to Youtube</a>

      <a> is the tag which is called "ancor tag"
      href is the attribute and "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=3703s" is the value.
      target is another attribute which determinates how the link is going to open. With _blank as value it will open in a new tab. If omitted, the link will open in the current page.

      Please note that HTML defines only the structure of a web page. The style/appearance is handled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
      So, as an example, if we want some space between a bottom and another one we do not simply put spaces between the 2 HTML botton tags: there is a proper way to do it with CSS.
      If we try to put spaces in HTML scripts, the compiler will ignore them and no modifies will appear on our web page.

      Anyway, adding spaces and lines in HTML scripts, is usefull to enhance readbility or, as it is called in coding, indentation. 
      Indentation is not only about the readability: putting something "under" something else helps to explain the logic of your code too. Example:

      code line one
        code line two
          code line three
      
      If something is indented in this way, we can understand that line three is part of two which is part of one. 
      Writing in this way, would have been different:

      code line one
      code line two
        code line three

      This would have meant that line three is still part of two, but lines two and one are not bounded in any way and they have got the same "importance"
      Note that is HTML convention says that there must be 2 spaces at each tab.
      In VS Code we can see how many spaces we are using on the left bottom corner under the voice "Spaces:"

      <strong>Devtools2ndParagraph:</strong> This paragraph will have some special caracthers called entity in HTML. 

      <br>

      To find them, just google the name of the thing that you want + HTML entity. Example: middle dot HTML entity.

      <br>
            
      This is a middle dot: <strong class="MiddleDotEntity">&#183;</strong> and this is a checkmark: &#10004;

    <div><h2>CSS Box Model</h2> 

      <p>
          
        Again: check the tutorial out or just explore.
            
        <br>
            
        CSS Box Model is used to determinate how much space an element takes up and how far it is away from other elements.

        <br>
            
        This box is composed of 4 elements: a content area, a padding, a border and a margin. Studying the properties of this file, it will be clear what exactly they are. 
        Just a note: content area is the actual space taken by an element. So, to modify that, you need to use heigh and widht properties. Whenever you are modifing a text, an image or whatever.

      </p>

    </div>



    <div><h2>Learning about images</h2> 

      <p>
          
        The first thing to use an image is to find an image: a way to do that could be using the Chrome DevTools, selecting the image, hovering on its link contained in attribue "src",
        clicking the link inside "current source" voice that will appear. Now a new tab will be opened.

            
        <br>

        Second thing is saving that image inside <u>the same folder</u> that contains our web page's code.
        Of course we can also save the image in a sub-folder of the main folder, like i did for this page. That sub-folder may be title "images".
      
        <br>

        Third is using the img tag with src attribute that tells to computer which image to display.
        if you want, you can add the alt attribute which will contain some text that will replace the image in case the pc in not able to find or display the image for any reason.
        The risult is what you can see below:

        <br>

        <img src="BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">

        <img src="C:\Users\Paolo\Desktop\HTML-CSS-YT tutorial\IntroToHTMLandCSS\Images\BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">

        <img class="BMTHImage" src="C:\Users\Paolo\Desktop\HTML-CSS-YT tutorial\IntroToHTMLandCSS\Images\BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">

        <img class="BMTHImage2" src="C:\Users\Paolo\Desktop\HTML-CSS-YT tutorial\IntroToHTMLandCSS\Images\BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">

        Note how you need to copy the hole image path. To do that, right-click on the image or its name and select something like "copy path"

        <br>

        Of course you can modify with CSS the image using class attribute, as for any HTML tag.

        <br>

      </p>


    
  </div>
  


  <div><h2>Learning about boxes</h2> 

    <p>
        
      There are more kind of boxes: text, email, checkbox...with varois kind of attributes. 
      Jere is an example:
          
      <br>
      
      <img class="BMTHImage3" src="C:\Users\Paolo\Desktop\HTML-CSS-YT tutorial\IntroToHTMLandCSS\Images\BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">

      <input class = "TextBox "type="text" placeholder="Search" name="" id="">

      <p>this line is a paragraph</p>

      <p>this line is another paragraph</p>

      <p>As you can see, the text box is beside the image while these paragraphs are under the image. Why is that? This is due to display property in CSS</p>

    </p>

  </div>



  <div><h2>Display property in CSS</h2> 

    <p>We have got 3 types of elements in CSS:



        <ol>



          <li><strong>block element:</strong></li>
              <p class="FirstListItem" >
                Does not matter the actual content area of an element, it always will take up the entiere line, 
                meaning that even if there is "-" as margin value in the CSS box model (so in there is no margin value) the margin area will actually occupy the entiere line.
                
                <br>

                EX: a paragraph by default is block element

              </p>



          <li><strong>inline-block element:</strong></li>
              <p>
                it takes up only the needed space, without occupying all the line. So another element could appear beside it.

                <br>

                EX: image and input tags.

              </p>
              



          <li><strong>inline element:</strong></li>
              <p>
                It always appears within a line of text.

                <br>

                EX: strong or u tags.

              </p>

        </ol>



        <p>        
          I still reccomand to check out the tutorial for this because in the video you see these things using the Chrome Devtools
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Another interesting thing is the that a block element can be turned into a inline block element and viceversa using the "display" CSS property. Here two examples:</p>



        <ul>

            <li><strong>From block to inline block:</strong></li>

            <p class="FromBlockToInlineBlockOne">paragraph 1 </p>
            <p class="FromBlockToInlineBlockTwo">paragraph 2 </p>

            <p>As you can see now the two paragraphs are on the same line, despite being block elements by default</p>

            <br>

            <li><strong>from inline block to block:</strong></li>

            <img class="BMTHImage4FromInlineBlockToBlock" src="C:\Users\Paolo\Desktop\HTML-CSS-YT tutorial\IntroToHTMLandCSS\Images\BrngMeToTheHorizon.jpg" alt="Image not available">
            <input class="TEXTFromInlineBlockToBlock"type="text">

            <p>As you can see now the two tags are on different lines, despite being inline block elements by default</p>


        </ul>
      

    </p>

  </div>



<div class="DivDeepening"><h2 class="DivDeepeningTitle">A little deepening about &lt;div&gt;	tag </h2>

    <p>

      I have been using div throughout the code but never explaned what really is: div tag can contain any tag, inclueded others div tags, and for this reason is usefull to:

      <br>

      make understand to other developers the logic we used to build a page when they look at our code and to
      regroup some elements in a single section in order to easly move or modify that group of elements creating the page layout we want.

      <br>

      Note that if we assign a width value, like i did for this section, to a div element, all the block elements contained will get the maximum width possibile BUT within the div's width.
  
    </p>

</div>



<div><h2>Let's use div to display more elements regrouped in 3 sections in the same line</h2>

      <div class="ElementsInOrizontalLineOne">

<div><h2>Advanced technique: nested layouts technique</h2>

  <p>
    This technique allows us to create almost any kind of web stucture because it is all about combining a vertical alignment of elements with an orizontal alignment of elements:
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see, we first have got a vertical alignment (external red), which contains a orizontal alignment (blue), which contains another vertical alignment (internal red):
